🧵 Just launched VaultCollect — the beautiful way to track your collections.

I'm a collector. I've got trading cards, vinyl records, vintage comics... and absolutely no idea what any of it is worth.

So I built the app I wanted to use.

📸 Photo catalog every item in your collection

Snap photos, add descriptions, track conditions — mint, excellent, good, fair, poor.

Your collection deserves better than a spreadsheet.
